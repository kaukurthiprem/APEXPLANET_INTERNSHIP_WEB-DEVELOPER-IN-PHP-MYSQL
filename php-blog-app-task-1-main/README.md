📖 Project Overview

This repository contains all tasks completed during my ApexPlanet Internship, focused on real-world full-stack web development, security enhancements, cloud deployment, and backend functionalities.

Each task is organized into separate folders with complete code, configuration files, and documentation. The project showcases practical implementation of core concepts such as authentication, API development, database operations, CRUD modules, and security improvements.
